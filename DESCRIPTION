Version: 0.1.0
Author: Nathan DeMaagd
Maintainer: Nathan DeMaagd <nate.demaagd@gmail.com>
Description: Sometimes when scatterplots have points that are too close, not even an alpha parameter helps to see point density. The function in the package, `get_point_density`, creates a vector of values for each observation based on the number of other observations in the vicinity.
